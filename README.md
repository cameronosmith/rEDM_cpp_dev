## Empirical Dynamic Modeling (EDM)
---
This package implements an R wrapper of [EDM](http://deepeco.ucsd.edu/nonlinear-dynamics-research/edm/) tools [cppEDM](https://github.com/SugiharaLab/cppEDM). See the [rEDM vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rEDM/vignettes/rEDM-tutorial.html) for a lucid introduction to EDM. 

Functionality includes:
* Simplex projection (Sugihara and May 1990)
* Sequential Locally Weighted Global Linear Maps (S-map) (Sugihara 1994)
* Multivariate embeddings (Dixon et. al. 1999)
* Convergent cross mapping (Sugihara et. al. 2012)
* Multiview embedding (Ye and Sugihara 2016)
