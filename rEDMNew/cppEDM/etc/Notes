General notes

1) The OSX XCode compiler/linker seems to be incompatible with the C++11
   standard implementation allowing template classes to be distributed into
   declarations (.h) and implementation (.cc).  However, this does entail
   explicit declaration of specialised template types in the .cc file.
   To support OSX, DataFrame.h contains both declarations and implemenations.
   See: libstdc++_Notes.txt.

2) The code relies heavily on class and data containers without explicit
   heap allocation.  This facilitates garbage collection.  It may be that
   copy-on-return for large data objects creates a performance issue.
   If the code encounters massive data objects/large problems, this may
   pose a limitation.

3) Eigen template library. The recommended SVD solver is the BDCSVD that
   scales to large problems. The Eigen documentation states:
     This algorithm is unlikely to provide accurate results when
     compiled with unsafe math optimizations. For instance, this concerns
     Intel's compiler (ICC), which performs such optimization by default
     unless you compile with the -fp-model precise option. Likewise,
     the -ffast-math option of GCC or clang will significantly degrade
     accuracy.
   See: https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/group__TutorialLinearAlgebra.html

   Note that when running the SMap circle.csv test, the BDCSVD solver with
   default parameters produces occasional divergence.  We have therefore
   defaulted to the JacobiSVD solver. 

4) Eigen template library. Eigen allows replacement of it's internal
   template library routines with direct calls to BLAS/LAPACK libraries.
   See: https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/TopicUsingBlasLapack.html
   This may offer performance and stability advantages.

5) SVD for S-map.  To completely excise Eigen or other 3rd party libraries
   for S-map SVD, one can call the BLAS/LAPACK dgesdd_() directly.
   An example of such a C++ implementation is in lapack_dgesdd.cc.
